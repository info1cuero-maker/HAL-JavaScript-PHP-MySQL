<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a pixel-perfect clone of the website . Initially, the request was to write clean code to replace the existing WordPress template for better performance.

Throughout the conversation, the user added more requirements:
- Full backend functionality (registration, adding companies, search).
- Use real Ukrainian company names from the original site.
- Use placeholders for images initially.
- Support for two languages (Ukrainian/Russian).
- Create specific pages: Blog, Contacts, About Us, Company Cards.
- Implement a user's personal cabinet (dashboard) to edit information and view statistics (views, comments).
- Company detail pages should have a gallery of up to 10 images, an address, and a map.
- The blog and company pages should be populated with more detailed data for a better visual representation.
- The search page URL must change dynamically when a category is selected.
- **CRITICAL**: The user's final request was to completely discard the existing Python/React stack and rewrite the entire application using **PHP + MySQL and Vanilla JavaScript**.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in Russian and Ukrainian. The next agent **MUST** respond in **Russian**.

**what currently exists?**
The agent has built a full-stack application with a React frontend, a FastAPI (Python) backend, and a MongoDB database, cloning the requested website. This version includes multiple pages, API endpoints, database models, and data seeding scripts. It also has features for data export to WordPress.

However, the user explicitly requested to discard this entire stack. The current code should only be considered a reference for features and UI. The project is now at the starting point of a complete rewrite using PHP, MySQL, and Vanilla JavaScript.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Acknowledging the user's request for a complete technology stack change to PHP + MySQL + Vanilla JavaScript and planning the rewrite.
-   **Status**: NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: After the rewrite, the agent should use the backend testing agent for the PHP/MySQL part and the frontend testing agent for the Vanilla JS part.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: A syntax error () occurred in the Python seeding script () when the agent tried to re-run it. This script is now obsolete, but the data and logic within it must be correctly ported to a new seeding mechanism for the MySQL database.
    -   Priority: P1
    -   Status: NOT STARTED
-   **Issue 2**: The  file was created as an empty placeholder to fix a frontend compilation error. The actual user dashboard feature needs to be implemented from scratch in the new stack.
    -   Priority: P2
    -   Status: NOT STARTED

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Rewrite the entire application from React/FastAPI/MongoDB to Vanilla JavaScript/PHP/MySQL.
    -   Priority: P0
    -   Where to resume: Start by creating a new directory structure for a classic PHP/JS project. Delete or archive the old  and  directories.
    -   What will be achieved with this?: The project will meet the user's latest and most critical requirement for the technology stack.
    -   Status: NOT STARTED
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Both

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   (P0) Set up the new project structure for PHP, MySQL, and Vanilla JS.
    -   (P0) Create the MySQL database schema based on the previously defined models (, , , , , ).
    -   (P0) Implement backend functionality in PHP:
        -   API endpoints for all CRUD operations.
        -   User authentication (registration, login).
        -   Search and filtering logic.
    -   (P0) Rewrite the frontend using Vanilla JavaScript, ensuring it communicates with the new PHP backend.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   (P1) Implement the user's personal cabinet (Dashboard) with features to edit user info and view company statistics.
    -   (P1) On the company details page, implement an image gallery (up to 10 images) and an embedded map for the company's address.
    -   (P2) Create a new data seeding script for PHP/MySQL and populate the database with rich content (images, descriptions, reviews) as previously requested.
    -   (P2) Implement dynamic URL changes on the search page based on the selected category (e.g., ).

**Completed work in this session**
The following work was completed for the now-obsolete React/FastAPI stack. It should be used as a reference for the rewrite.
-   **Frontend (React)**: Created pages for Home, Search, Company Details, Blog, Contacts, About, Add Business, and file downloads.
-   **Backend (FastAPI)**: Developed models and API endpoints for Companies, Users, Reviews, Categories, Blogs, and Stats. Implemented user auth with JWT.
-   **Data Migration**: Created Python scripts and Markdown guides for migrating data to/from WordPress (, ).
-   **Database**: Seeded a MongoDB database with initial data.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1**: The application crashed because the  component was imported but the file did not exist.
    -   **Attempted fix**: The agent created an empty  file.
    -   **Why it's still relevant**: This fixes the crash but the actual feature is unimplemented. This needs to be built in the new stack.
-   **Issue 2**: The Python data seeding script () had a syntax error when the agent tried to update it.
    -   **Attempted fix**: The agent identified the file but was interrupted by the user's request to change the stack.
    -   **Why it's still relevant**: The logic for populating the database with rich data is still a requirement and needs to be reimplemented correctly for MySQL.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**
-   **Previous (Obsolete)**: A full-stack application with a  directory (React, ) and a  directory (FastAPI, Python). The database was MongoDB.
-   **Target (To be built)**: A classic web stack. The backend will be written in PHP, serving API requests and connecting to a MySQL database. The frontend will be built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, making AJAX calls to the PHP backend.

**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Previous**: React, FastAPI, MongoDB, REST APIs, JWT Authentication.
-   **Target**: PHP, MySQL, Vanilla JavaScript, AJAX.

**key DB schema**
The following structure was defined for MongoDB and should be translated to MySQL tables:
-   **companies**: , , ,  (array), ,  (array), ,  (coordinates).
-   **users**: , , , .
-   **reviews**: , , , .
-   **categories**: , .
-   **stats**: , Fri Dec 26 07:14:48 UTC 2025, , .

**changes in tech stack**
A complete migration was requested by the user:
-   **Frontend**: React.js → **Vanilla JavaScript**
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) → **PHP**
-   **Database**: MongoDB → **MySQL**

**All files of reference**
The following files from the previous implementation are useful references for features and data structure, but will be replaced:
-   : Contains all API endpoint definitions.
-   : Directory with all Pydantic models (data schema).
-   : Contains the logic and data for populating the database.
-   : Directory with all React page components, showing the UI structure.
-   : Initial plan for API contracts.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
The entire project must be rebuilt from scratch using the new technology stack. All existing code in  and  is now obsolete.

**key api endpoints**
The following REST endpoints were defined in FastAPI and should be re-created in PHP:
-   , 
-   
-   , , 
-   
-   
-   
-   

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The most important directive is that the user has mandated a complete rewrite of the application. **Do not continue working on the Python/React codebase.** All previous work should only be used as a blueprint for features, data structures, and UI layout for the new **PHP, MySQL, and Vanilla JavaScript** implementation. Confirm the new structure with the user before writing a large amount of code.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.   (excellent start rewriting)
2.   (1. Backend technology: PHP + MySQL (traditional approach) 2. Frontend: Rewrite in pure JavaScript 3. Reason for stack change: Personal preference)
3.   (rewrite the site completely in JavaScript. It is also acceptable to use PHP and MySQL. do not use Python)
4.   (yes, run it and make it so in the search section the URL changes when you select a category (so that each category has its own site page))
5.   (nothing has changed. you didn't add the information)
6.   (add some photos, description, map, contacts and reviews to the cards so I can see what it looks like live. also add information to the blog articles so I can see it clearly)
7.   (okay, prepare the data for me to upload to hosting)
8.   (the cards should have up to 10 images, also there should be a company address and a map showing where the company is located)
9.   (check the site it's not working)
10.  (it's not working)

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: The entire application is functionally broken from the user's perspective because it is not built on the desired tech stack. The previous React frontend is also in a non-compiling state due to a missing (but now irrelevant)  component.
-   **Mocked**: All previous work can be considered a mock or prototype for the final PHP/JS version.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None currently active. The plan involves using Google Fonts and potentially a map service (like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap) for the company address feature.

**Testing status**
-   Backend testing was performed on the FastAPI version and passed.
-   No testing has been performed since the major change request.
-   Test files created: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   None required at this stage.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent updated the  script with more data but failed to execute it due to a syntax error. This is now moot due to the stack change but was a missed step in the previous workflow.
-   The agent created a placeholder  to fix a crash but did not implement the actual dashboard feature before the user's focus shifted.</analysis>
